								<p>Leeann Leahy came to&nbsp;<a title="See recent content about Via" href="http://lookbook.adage.com/Agencies/The-VIA-Agency">The Via Agency</a>&nbsp;as president in December from Translation, New York, to help CEO John Coleman take the Portland, Maine, hotshop up a notch further by improving creative&nbsp; and client service.</p>
								<p>She arrived just as Via won its biggest client yet, Sam&rsquo;s Club, which meant adding about 20 new staffers, bringing the total to 117. Via also recently added Republic Wireless, a value-oriented provider, and launched efforts for Perdue Farms and&nbsp;<a title="See recent content about Unilever" href="http://adage.com/directory/unilever/288">Unilever</a>&rsquo;s Klondike.</p>
								<p>She describes Via&rsquo;s clients as &ldquo;huge brands with complicated issues,&rdquo; but she&rsquo;s had experience with that, working on Bud Light at Translation and running the worldwide Johnson &amp; Johnson business at Lowe.</p>
								<p>If new hires are gunning for her job, she&rsquo;s happy. Among the best advice she ever got: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to hire your replacement, because that&rsquo;s how you get the best people and it encourages you to go to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
